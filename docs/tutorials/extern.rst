Importing tree ensemble models
==============================

Since the scope of treelite is limited to **prediction** only, one must use
other machine learning packages to **train** decision tree ensemble models. In
this document, we will show how to import an ensemble model that had been
trained elsewhere.

Importing XGBoost models
------------------------

**XGBoost** (`dmlc/xgboost <https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/>`_) is a fast,
scalable package for gradient boosting. Both treelite and XGBoost are hosted
by the DMLC (Distributed Machine Learning Community) group.

Treelite plays well with XGBoost --- if you used XGBoost to train your ensemble
model, you need only one line of code to import it. Depending on where your
model is located, you should do one of the following:

* Load XGBoost model from a :py:class:`xgboost.Booster` object

.. code-block:: python

  # bst = an object of type xgboost.Booster
  model = Model.from_xgboost(bst)

* Load XGBoost model from a binary model file

.. code-block:: python

  # model had been saved to a file named my_model.model
  # notice the second argument format='xgboost'
  model = Model.load('my_model.model', format='xgboost')

Importing LightGBM models
-------------------------

**LightGBM** (`Microsoft/LightGBM <https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM>`_) is
another well known machine learning package for gradient boosting. To import
models generated by LightGBM, use the :py:meth:`~treelite.Model.load` method
with argument ``format='lightgbm'``:

.. code-block:: python

  # model had been saved to a file named my_model.txt
  # notice the second argument format='lightgbm'
  model = Model.load('my_model.txt', format='lightgbm')

How about other packages?
-------------------------
If you used other packages to train your ensemble model, you'd need to specify
the model programmatically. There are two ways to do this:

* :doc:`builder`
* :doc:`protobuf`
